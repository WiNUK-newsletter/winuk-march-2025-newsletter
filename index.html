            <span class="hello">HELLO WINUK COMMUNITY,</span><br />
            Over the past centuries, we have witnessed great advances in medical
            research that highlight how supporting scientific research leads to
            a better future. Despite the significant improvements, there are
            still medical conditions that lack a strong translational result,
            placing greater attention on the importance of scientific
            progression in these areas. March represents Brain Tumour Awareness
            Month. Brain tumours are one of the research priorities in urgent
            need of treatments that are safer and more effective.
            <br /><br />At WiNUK, we celebrate the amazing achievements made by
            scientists over the years to tackle medical conditions like brain
            cancer and we support the research in this area to help those
            affected live longer and better. Moreover, as March represents the
            month for International Women‚Äôs Day, we want to particularly
            emphasise the contribution of women in this field who tirelessly and
            constantly work towards scientific progression.<br /><br />

            </p>
            <p>
              Our Founder, Lizzie, will be speaking about her journey in
              dementia research, how to get involved in Women in Neuroscience
              UK, and the gender disparities in both dementia-related diseases
              and research workplaces. It‚Äôs a great chance to connect, learn,
              and discuss ways to improve inclusivity and representation in
              neuroscience.
            </p>

              The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated
              on February 11th each year. It's all about recognising the
              achievements of women and girls in science, highlighting their
              contributions, and promoting gender equality in STEM fields
              (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).<br />
              It matters because historically, women have been underrepresented
              in these fields despite having made significant contributions.
              This day raises awareness about the importance of empowering women
              and girls to pursue careers in science and technology, ensuring
              they have equal opportunities for education, research, and
              professional growth. By encouraging more women and girls to enter
              STEM, we can tap into a broader talent pool, foster innovation,
              and address global challenges more effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              WiNUK aims to empower women in neuroscience by amplifying voices,
              fostering connections, and creating opportunities for growth.
              Together, we‚Äôre breaking barriers and inspiring the next
              generation of female neuroscientists!<br />
