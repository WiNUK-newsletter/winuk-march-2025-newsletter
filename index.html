            <span class="hello">HELLO WINUK COMMUNITY,</span><br />
            Over the past centuries, we have witnessed great advances in medical
            research that highlight how supporting scientific research leads to
            a better future. Despite the significant improvements, there are
            still medical conditions that lack a strong translational result,
            placing greater attention on the importance of scientific
            progression in these areas. March represents Brain Tumour Awareness
            Month. Brain tumours are one of the research priorities in urgent
            need of treatments that are safer and more effective.
            <br /><br />At WiNUK, we celebrate the amazing achievements made by
            scientists over the years to tackle medical conditions like brain
            cancer, and we support the research in this area to help those
            affected live longer and better. Moreover, as March represents the
            month for International Women‚Äôs Day, we want to particularly
            emphasise the contribution of women in this field who tirelessly and
            constantly work towards scientific progression.<br /><br />

            <p>
              PYLT is back, and this month, Anna Jansson, from the MRC
              Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge,
              showed how she uses automated two-electrode voltage clamp on
              Xenopus oocytes (frog eggs) to study G-protein coupled receptors
              in the octopus visual system.
            </p>
            <p>
              This powerful technique allows her to screen for ligands that bind
              to protein targets identified through genomic data, helping
              unravel key neurobiology molecular mechanisms üîç‚ú®.

                  The 8th of March marked International Women‚Äôs Day. It
                  celebrates women's achievements while acknowledging the
                  ongoing fight for gender equity. In neuroscience and beyond,
                  women continue to face barriers to career progression,
                  recognition, and leadership opportunities. Women in
                  Neuroscience UK (WiNUK) is working to change that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our event in response to International Women‚Äôs Day is on the
                  2nd of April, at The Rosalind Franklin Institute called Women
                  in Science: Overcoming Barriers and Unlocking New Career
                  Opportunities.

                  Last November, we hosted the inaugural WiNUK Awards,
                  celebrating trailblazing women in the field. Our mission is to
                  inspire, connect, and advocate for women* and girls*
                  interested in neuroscience. From cutting-edge research to
                  career advice and gender equity advocacy, we amplify the
                  voices of women in neuroscience and drive meaningful change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By fostering an inclusive and supportive community, we‚Äôre
                  creating a future where all women in neuroscience can thrive.
                  Together, we can break barriers, challenge biases, and shape a
                  more diverse and inclusive scientific landscape.

          <h3>BRAIN AWARENESS WEEK (BAW)</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
              This is the third year WiNUK has participated in BAW, which takes
              place from 10 to 16 March. It typically involves various
              activities organised by universities, hospitals, research
              institutes, and advocacy groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to educate people about the brain, neuroscience
              research, and brain disorders, fostering a greater understanding
              of how our brains work and how to maintain their health. It's a
              great initiative to promote brain science and its importance in
              our lives!

              Exploring what‚Äôs next: Tea and Talk, University of Birmingham -
              26th Feb
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our first Tea and Talk event hosted at The University of
              Birmingham was a success! A group of hosts, mentors and attendees
              had an informal but productive chat covering advice for finding a
              good PhD supervisor, the perks of moving around to different labs
              vs staying put and the mentors‚Äô paths to their careers now ‚Äì all
              over a cup of tea and snacks!
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the biggest worries about entering postgraduate life was
              the idea of committing to one decision, so it was inspiring and
              reassuring to hear about different pathways into the field! Thank
              you to our amazing mentors and to everyone who attended the event.
              We hope to put on more Tea and Talk events at other universities
              in the future!
